**Answer:**</br>


<p>Through implementing WIP<p>
<p>Through controlling how much unfinished work is in process, you can reduce the time it takes an item to travel through the Kanban system. You can also avoid problems 
  caused by task switching and reduce the need to constantly reprioritize items. WIP limits unlock the full potential of 
  Kanban, enabling teams to deliver quality work faster than ever in a healthier, more sustainable environment.</p>

**Answer:**</br>

Using cycle times, throughput, Cumulative Flow Diagram, Bottle necks </br>

***Cycle time:** then, is the metric that directly measures how long it takes your team to deliver a task. Low cycle times means your team is working efficiently, high cycle times indicate that something is stalling your process.</br>
***Throughput:** metric in Kanban measures the total amount of work delivered in a certain time period. Throughput only measures completed work items – nothing that is still in progress gets counted.</br>
***Cumulative flow diagram:** shows the distribution of tasks in each of the process states, accumulating over time. </br>
***Bottlenecks –** increasing work that is not being completed. The bottleneck signals that your team does not have the resource capacity to handle the amount of work assigned to them in a timely manner. </br>
